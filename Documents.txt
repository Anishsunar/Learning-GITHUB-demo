<---------GIT HUB------------>
Website that alows developers to store and manage theri code using Git.
https//.github.com
we upload out complete code here in folder(Repository{Repo}) form.
<-------Github Account--------->
-------->Create a new repository: LearningGIThub-demo
        Provide description.
    Choose:
        public: viewed to public.
        private: not viewed to public.
    Initialize this repository with: Read me:
                                            A details discription about our projects.

    Then  we create our repository.
    README.md ---> .md means mark down.
    initial commit -----> our first commit
-------->Make our first commit
To final changes we call it commit.
<---------SETTING UP GIT--------------->
Visual Studio code
Window (Git Bash)
Mac(Terminal)
VERIFY --->  git --version
<-------------CONFIGURING GIT(Telling git from which account we are changing)--------------->
git coonfig --global user.name "My Name" ---> global and local
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
git config --list
<-----------Some Basic commands------------->
cd --> change directory(when we want to go inside folder)
--->Eg: PS C:\Python Projects\GitHub> cd .\Learning-GITHUB-demo\
cls --> to clear the terminal.
ls --> list files and folders
ls -a --> for hidden files.


--------->CLONE AND STATUS:
Clone---> Cloning a github repository on our local machine.
         git clone <-some link->
         """
         remote             local
         [Github]           [Laptop/PC]
         """

Status---> display the status of the code
          git status
modified:   README.md:(when the file is modified we need to follow two step process.)
                        1->add
                        2->commit
        When we use Git status we have 4 types of file:
        1->untracked:-- new file that git doesnot yet tracked.

        2->modified:-- changed
        3-> staged:-- file is ready to be committed
                    when the file is add, then the file is staged
                    then, the file is commit, which is unchanged.
        4->unmodified:-- unchanged
------------------->Add & commit

add---> adds new or changed file in your working directory to Git staging area.
        git add <-file name->
        eg: Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   index.html

commit ---> it is the record of change.
            git commit -m"some message"
        Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. (meand we are 1 step a head of github in our local machine{Laptop})
        the file is not seen in the github. so, we need to 1 more command  which is push command.

------------>Push command
push---> upload local repo content to remote repo.
            git push origin main
